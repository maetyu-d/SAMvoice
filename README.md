The SAM-style Voice Synthesizer is based on the original SAM Software Automatic Mouth, a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program from the 1980s. For the original code, see: [https://github.com/discordier/sam?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/discordier/sam?tab=readme-ov-file), but this plugin is significantly extended in various noisy and glitchy ways that are quite entertaining. There's a quick video demo [HERE](https://youtu.be/Swlm50KDbZo). Thanks to Harry Hicks for getting me to try to port it, or this wouldn't exist.

VST3 and AU builds, via JUCE, are provided in the repo.
